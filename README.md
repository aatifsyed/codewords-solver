# Codewords Solver
Codewords are a kind of word puzzle.  
This gave me a chance to implement backtracking recursion, and also to practice generators and comprehensions.  

## TODO
- Have a trie as a dictionary for better performance

Uses the dictionary from [dwyl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
